# StableHLO Governance

## Future governance

We aim to establish an open governance model drawing from standards such as
LLVM, with particular emphasis on open design/roadmap discussions, public
process for gaining technical steering rights, and OSS-first docs & repo
governance (e.g. repo location, CLA, etc.).

## Near-term governance

During the bootstrapping phase of the project in 2022, Google engineers will
assume responsibility for the technical leadership of the project. It is a high
priority to create a path for community members to take on technical
leadership roles.
