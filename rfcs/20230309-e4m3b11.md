# RFC: E4M3B11FNUZ in XLA

Status: Approved<br/>
Initial version: 3/9/2023<br/>
Last updated: 3/24/2023

## Summary

Google has hardware which features a floating-point format similar to the one
recommended in Sun et al.[^1]:

- 1 sign bit
- 4 exponent bits
- 3 significand bits

At first glance, this format seems similar to the E4M3FN[^2] format already
present in XLA and the E4M3FNUZ[^3] format in LLVM but there are some important
differences. Let's take a look at the details.

## Details

Let's compare some values representable in E4M3B11FNUZ with E4M3FN and E4M3FNUZ:

|                   |E4M3FN                                |E4M3FNUZ                               |E4M3B11FNUZ                           |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Bias               |7                                     |8                                      |11                                    |
|Min Normal Value   |±0001.000 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-6</sup>      |±0001.000 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-7</sup>       |±0001.000 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-10</sup>     |
|Max Normal Value   |±1111.110 = 1.75 * 2<sup>8</sup> = 448|±1111.111 = 1.875 * 2<sup>7</sup> = 240|±1111.111 = 1.875 * 2<sup>4</sup> = 30|
|Min Subnormal Value|±0000.001 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-9</sup>      |±0000.001 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-10</sup>      |±0000.001 = 1.0 * 2<sup>-13</sup>     |
|Max Subnormal Value|±0000.111 = 0.875 * 2<sup>-6</sup>    |±0000.111 = 0.875 * 2<sup>-7</sup>     |±0000.111 = 0.875 * 2<sup>-10</sup>   |
|Infinity           |N/A                                   |N/A                                    |N/A                                   |
|NaN                |±1111.111                             |-0000.000                              |-0000.000                             |
|-0                 |-0000.000                             |N/A                                    |N/A                                   |

These differences are caused by:

- A difference in exponent bias changes the range of representable numbers.
- E4M3FN reserves the all one exponent and trailing significand field to
represent NaN, the other formats use the representation which would be used by
negative zero to represent NaN.
- E4M3FN can represent negative zero in the normal way, the other formats
cannot represent negative zero.

## Changes in XLA

Adding this type will be mostly along the same lines as the
[FP8 RFC](https://github.com/openxla/xla/discussions/22): a new type added to
the formats already supported; scaling will be represented in the same way it
is supported in other FP8 formats. Additionally, this type would also become
added to LLVM's APFloat class and MLIR.
