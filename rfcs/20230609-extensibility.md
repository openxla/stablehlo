# Summary

As part of the ongoing review of [the TopK RFC](https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo/pull/1593),
we have come up with a sketch of a design that allows arbitrary operations to
define StableHLO decompositions. PTAL at
[[RFC] StableHLO Extensibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSyyLA-p1F7KjZgjo563F1WFsPwcZc4eaH5WyQfbsi0/edit#heading=h.kfv34azf3j5k).
