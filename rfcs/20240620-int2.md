## Introduction

Sub-byte integer types are commonly used for model quantization. StableHLO
currently supports signed and unsigned 4-bit integer types. Here we propose to
extend the specification to cover 2-bit integer types as well.

## Proposal

Change the Types section of the spec to include si2 (signed 2-bit integer) and
ui2 (unsigned 2-bit integer):

```text
SignedIntegerType ::= 'si2' | 'si4' | 'si8' | 'si16' | 'si32' | 'si64'
UnsignedIntegerType ::= 'ui2' | 'ui4' | 'ui8' | 'ui16' | 'ui32' | 'ui64'
```

Add 2 to the list of supported bit width for integer types

```text
Integer types can be either signed (si) or unsigned (ui) and have one of the
supported bit widths (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64).
```
