    Walks through a StableHLO program refining shapes within ops.

    The flagship use case for this pass is specializing dynamically-shaped
    programs to static shapes. If a dynamically-shaped StableHLO program has the
    right structure, then updating its argument types from dynamic shapes to
    static shapes and running this pass will propagate static shapes across
    the program.
